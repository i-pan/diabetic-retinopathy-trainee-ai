# Impact of Artificial Intelligence on DR Grading by Ophthalmology Residents

This repository contains the code for our work studying the impact of AI on ophthalmology residents. 

It uses public datasets and should be more or less fully reproducible, except for small model differences that result from atomic operations on the GPU.

A step-by-step guide to running the code in this repository will be available shortly.
